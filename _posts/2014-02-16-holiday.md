Kids play in the street  
on a Sunday at eight  
No school in the morning  
they all can sleep late

But your life will go on  
without holiday  
without any respite  
from a regular day

The clock still gets punched  
at a quarter to nine  
some bourbon in your coffee  
and march down the line

She’s gone and you’re haunted  
by that which remains  
nothing of consequence  
nothing to claim

Perhaps there is time  
to salvage some shred  
of hope in your happiness,  
some color but red

The blood on the wall  
the pillow, the sheet  
dripping down to the floor  
puddled brilliant at your feet

The neighborhood’s gone quiet  
as you stand in the dark  
No one to call comfort  
The pain remains stark
