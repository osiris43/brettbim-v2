After three days in a row of really hard workouts, some poor quality sleep and a sketchy diet, I was looking forward to a rest day today. As it turns out, my idea of a rest day sometimes morphs into something else, mostly because I underestimate the effort required for some project. Today, I had no plans to rebuild the south vegetable garden but that’s what we did. I did have a plan to prep that bed for spring planting but the more I thought about it, the more the design of the bed needed to be changed. When I built it years ago. there weren’t any blackberries taking up one whole side and I didn’t really have any experience with raised beds. It’s a long and wide bed, 20 feet by 5 feet and that makes it hard to plant, weed or do anything. After reading The [Square Foot Gardening](http://www.amazon.com/All-New-Square-Foot-Gardening/dp/1591862027), I realized how inefficient and difficult the bed was.

So today’s project became splitting 1 really big bed into 3 smaller, 4×5 foot beds. The level of effort seemed doable but in reality, it was a lot of work. Which brings us to the point of this post, I’m physically exhausted. Which is why tonight’s Lenten post is a little short on details and long on YouTube videos of Verlon Thompson playing The Guitar. Because that’s all I can manage. Hope your Saturday has been a fun and productive one.
