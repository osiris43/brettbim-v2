This is mostly a reminder for myself in six months when I need to do this again. Mara has an email on cryhavoctheater.org domain that is managed in Google Apps. I wrote about setting it up with Amazon Route 53 previously. Today, she wanted to also have info@cryhavoctheater.org set up. Turns out, this is as easy as creating an alias with Google Apps under her user account. I assume she can manage as many of those as necessary and it’s way cheaper than creating a new account every time.

In other news, I’ve added a subscribe functionality to this site so that if you don’t want to check in every six months to see what I’ve written, you can sign up to get email notifications. I promise to never do anything with your email other than send you those notifications. I have a post in mind comparing Uber to Walmart so you should sign up now so you don’t miss it.
