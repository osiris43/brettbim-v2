One thing I’ve learned from trying to write every day for 40 odd days is that it’s very hard to do. Even if you aren’t particularly worried about quality (and it’s clear I’m not), doing anything other than eating and breathing for 40 days in a row is difficult. Other things get in the way on a regular basis and the necessary commitment wanes over time leaving you wondering what in the hell you were thinking about when you made the commitment in the first place. Also, I could have sworn commitment had two t’s.

Apparently Mother Nature is pissed and is sending a cold front this direction late in the season for the second year in a row. Last year we had a freeze in April. This year, it’s going to be close but looks like we’ll miss freezing temps on Tuesday morning though there is a frost alert. I’m going to have to get out tomorrow or Monday and cover everything with plastic. I guess the constant stress might be good for the plants, makes them stronger but I’d prefer to not have to deal with it.

One thing commitment teaches you is that in order to be committed (now it has two t’s), you have to give up other things. My reading list is growing and I keep adding books to my Amazon wishlist with the full intent but zero time to read them. On top of that, I have to get a Kentucky Derby pool built in The Sports Pool Hub before May. It’s the work thing that really takes up so much time. I need to just retire. Alas, that probably isn’t happening any time soon.
