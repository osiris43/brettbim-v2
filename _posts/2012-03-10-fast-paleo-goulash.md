I came across [this great looking recipe](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/rich-and-hearty-hungarian-goulash/#axzz1oclSJqUR) for Hungarian goulash last week. I’m going to try it soon but since I only had 45 minutes today for lunch, I made a fast version with hamburger that turned out pretty good. It can’t compete with anything cooked in a slow cooker for hours but it makes a great 1 dish meal that you can make in under an hour.

1 pound of ground beef, bison, venison, elk, whatever. I used grass fed beef from a local farm.  
1 onion, chopped  
1 yellow squash, diced  
1 zucchini, diced  
1 bell pepper,diced  
2 cloves of garlic, minced or run through a garlic press if you’re lazy and in a hurry like me.  
paprika (I just threw some in until it looked nice and red)  
cumin (ditto)  
1 tablespoon of tomato paste  
1 cup of beef broth  
black pepper to taste  
salt to taste  
coconut oil (I liked the flavor it added but some people might just stick to the lard)  
lard (yup, lard. It’s good for you. Trust me, anything that comes from bacon is good for you)

Brown the beef in the coconut oil. Remove all of the above from the pan. Melt the lard and add the onions, paprika and cumin. Saute for until it looks and smells good, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and tomato paste and stir everything together. Add the meat back in along with the squash, zucchini and peppers. Add the broth and stir everything together. Cook on medium heat until the broth is reduced by half. Add pepper and salt if so desired. I added a little more cumin because I’m addicted to the stuff.

I ate it straight out of a bowl but you could serve it over sliced cabbage or cauliflower rice. The upside is that if you leave and come back home later, your house will smell fantastic.
