Today, cabbage, collards, mustard, Chinese cabbage and kale went in the ground. The transplants started last weekend are starting to make progress though the leeks haven’t germinated yet. We got 2.5 inches of rain on Thursday night into Friday, the first rain we’ve had in over 2 months. This weekend was the first rain of the fall and finally some cooler weather with highs in the low 80s and lows near 60 each morning. It’s supposed to warm back up this week but it seems like may summer has finally released her grip for another year.
