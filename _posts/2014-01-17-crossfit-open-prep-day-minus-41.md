So I’ve signed up for the [2014 CrossFit Open](http://games.crossfit.com/about-the-games/the-open). Two years ago, I did a couple of the workouts but apparently not enough to show up in the results. Last year, after 13.1 which involved a snatch ladder with 135 lbs as the second rung, I knew I was in over my head. Of course, I’m not doing it to compete in the Games. The chances of me competing in the Games are effectively zero, even though I have no reached the ripe old age of 41 and thus qualify for the entry level Masters division. CrossFit has become a true sport with TV and sponsors and all the associated pros and cons that go along with it. The elite athletes at all levels of the sport are so much farther removed from the average athlete that it’s like comparing Tiger Woods with the local club champion.

Still, there is something satisfying about having a goal to train towards in hopes of at least not running up against a workout that you have to sit and stare at the bar like I did last year on the 135lb snatch. As an aside, there’s been a snatch ladder each of the last two years. I’m guessing that probably won’t happen again but I’ll probably be trying to manage a 135lb snatch before February 27th anyway. I’m going to try and journal the process towards the Open that I’m taking. I haven’t worked out any particular workout plan other than to greatly increase my strength between then and now. My current maxes are woefully short of the necessary requirements just to do some of the metcons. I’ve been steadily increasing my squats, presses and deadlifts over the past 2-3 weeks. Some realistic goals might be a 225-250 lb squat, a 350 lb deadlift, a 185 lb clean and a 135 lb snatch. Those numbers alone would put me at the strongest I’ve ever been.

Today, I chose a workout from CrossFit Rockwall’s blog, 100 double unders followed by 3 rounds of 15 burpees and 15 toes to bar. My double unders are really weak right now and I’m not sure why. I’m afraid I cut the speed rope too short. The most I can string together is about 15 early on and then it’s lots of 5s and 6s. Total workout time was 12:07. I warmed up with 3 x Max chest to bar pullups with totals being 8 in each round. Pretty sure 45 toes to bar are going to come back to haunt me tomorrow. Ever try to poop when your stomach is sore? Yeah me neither, total hypothetical.

At lunch, we were eating on the Katy Trail and [a good friend of mine](http://mattflo.com) wanted to run a mile to keep his Run Streak Challenge going so after a bunless Terlingua burger, fries and 2 schooners of Crispin, off we went. Put in a 7:43 mile after all that so I guess metabolically, I’m not doing too badly.

So far this year, [I’ve put in 12 workouts in 17 days](http://wodstack.com/brettbim/workouts/calendar). I figure I’m going to need to keep that pace for the next 40 to insure enough capacity to complete most of the workouts. This week, I think I’ll work though some of the 2013 workouts just as a place to gauge progress. Unfortunately, that stupid snatch ladder will still be waiting.
