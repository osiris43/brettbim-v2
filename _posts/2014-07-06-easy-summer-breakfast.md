It’s the height of tomato season around here and we’re overwhelmed with tomatoes. I may or may not have overplanted this year but I just picked a pound of yellow pear tomatoes and there are more on the vines. With that kind of production, you have to find interesting ways to eat more tomatoes. I came up with this recipe after reading an article in Garden &amp; Gun regarding black cherry heirloom tomatoes. It’s an easy breakfast or lunch. Depending on your protein choice and your Paleo interpretation, you could call it Paleo though I used cottage cheese which might make some people’s toes curl.

**Sauteed Heirloom Tomatoes and Onions**  
Some olive oil  
1 onion chopped  
Cherry or pear tomoatoes, a handful per serving  
Torn basil  
Fresh cracked pepper  
sea salt  
A protein of your own choosing. I used cottage cheese but this would be good on eggs, leftover chicken or black beans.

Heat the oil in a cast iron pan over medium heat. Saute the onions until slightly soft. Add the tomatoes, salt and pepper and saute for just a minute or so. You aren’t trying to create sauce, just get them to release the flavor a little. Add the basil and remove from the heat. Put your protein in a bowl and top with the tomatoes, onions and basil mixture.
