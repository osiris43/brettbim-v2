This blog runs in Lightsail on WordPress with a Certified by Bitnami instance. Lately, Iâ€™ve run into the following when trying to ssh in from the Lightsail console:

A couple of times, a reboot of the instance seemed to fix it but this morning, nothing changed the behavior. So I decided to try to ssh from the terminal and lo and behold, this works. You have to download your private keys from your Lightsail account and then following [these instructions](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-ssh-using-terminal) worked fine from the terminal. This will probably be my default going forward.
