With deference to Eliot  
 And that Mister Mistoffelees  
Can you choose to name your cat  
 A sobriquet like Socrates?  
Or maybe since there is a cat  
 Already in the house who’s named  
Vincent, you figure surely that  
 Picasso for the newly tamed.  
His eyes are blue like oceans bay  
 So you could call him Frankie, too.  
He croons and purrs both night and day  
 And seems to get a kick outta you.  
But if T.S were truly right  
 And two monikers are required  
The pressure weighs and causes fright  
 In hopeless turmoil I am mired.  
A name is fixed and permanent  
 Forever by it he will go.  
I’ll hope for help from heaven sent  
 Barring that I’ll just call him Mo.
