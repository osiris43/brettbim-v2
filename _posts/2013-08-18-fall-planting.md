Pulled up the cucumbers and most of the cowpeas today though several more rows of Texas pinkeye cowpeas got planted on the north side of the house. The cucumbers had been planted back in late June. We got over 10 pounds but itâ€™s been too hot and they were looking pretty rangy. For the fall, I planted collards, spinach, a mesclun mix, Bush Blue Lake green beans and Jackson Wonder lima beans. I still probably have 100 square feet available for planting but want to save room for garlic, onions and more root vegetables like turnips and beets.
