ON the first real fall feeling day of the year, I planted another round of turnips, beets, collards, lettuce and radishes. [The first planting](http://www.anexperimentinscotch.com/2013/09/fall-gardening/) of the fall has been mostly disappointing as very little has flourished. The peas and radishes are sort of growing but other than that, the rest of the crop has been a bust. I’m not sure if it’s the heat we had in September or something else. I’ve been pretty consistent with the water so I don’t think that’s the problem. The turnips did well in the spring on the south side of the house so it’s not seeds. Hopefully this round is better.

[The planting from August](http://www.anexperimentinscotch.com/2013/08/fall-planting/) has also been disappointing with only lettuce being harvested so far. The package of green beans must have been bad because they haven’t flourished anywhere I’ve planted them. The lima beans came right up but haven’t produced anything yet. The collards and spinach never even germinated.
