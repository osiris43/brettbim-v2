Notes from my train ride in while reading From Dawn To Decadence:

[Girolamo Savonarola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Savonarola) was a Dominican friar whose campaign for religious reform included bonfires of the vanities, burning books, musical instruments and more.

Machiavelliâ€™s *La Mandragola* was an early classic comedy.

16C music was the defining point between harmony and polyphony.

Books to read include The English Poets Volume II and An Essay on French Verse for Readers of English Poetry
