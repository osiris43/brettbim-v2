 This is my digital home for writing, thinking and contemplation that doesn't fit anywhere else.  Family, books, philosophy, spirtuality. 

 I've been doing different forms of software engineering for over 20 years.  From IVRs written in VB to managing a team building a distributed system in the cloud to using Terraform, Ansible and Observability to help a company modernize, I have enjoyed a fruitful career filled with good people and technical challenges.

 Outside of work, I hunt, fish, spend as much time as I can outdoors with my family and try to get better at the guitar, fitfully.
